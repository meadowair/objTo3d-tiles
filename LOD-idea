You can find LOD sample data in there, which gives you an idea to implement LOD in 3D Tiles.

After you understand it, you can make LOD tileset by following steps :

Export .obj models with different level of detail.
Use obj23dtiles convert them to .b3dm.
Create or modify a tileset.json file follow sample data's tileset.json file.
I hope this is clear enough.
